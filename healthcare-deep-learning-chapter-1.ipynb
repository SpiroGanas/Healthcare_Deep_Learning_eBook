Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with the design of experiments, the collection of data, and the analysis of that data.  Statistics will ultimately determine how your data answers the research question.\n*   Computer Science Skills - Data can be \"dirty\".  Or you can have too much data to fit on a single computer (i.e. \"Big Data\").  Or the math involved can be so complex that you need to run it on a supercomputer, or on a GPU, or on a cluster of regular computers. The ability to program and other computer science skills distinguish data science from \"tranditional\" research.\n\nThe ultimate goal of all healthcare data scientists is to improve patient care by analyzing medical data and generating evidence that informs clinical practice.\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"id":"2q7S3ZFOtO_J"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h3>Why Now?</h3>\n\nDeep Learning is not a new technology, but it has only recently become accessible to most researchers.  There are three key reasons deep learning has become increasingly popular:\n\n1.   Training a large deep learning model involve many, many linear algebra calculations (too many for even the fastest CPUs to handle in a reasonable amount of time).  In 2007, NVidia relased [CUDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA), a parallel computing platform that let's you run all this math on a GPU card.  As of July 2019, NVidia's V100 GPU is advertising a speed of [112 Teraflops on deep leaning problems.](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-v100/), offering \"the performance of up to 100 CPUs in a single GPU.\" \n2.   TensorFlow and Keras, two Python libraries that make it easier to design and train neural networks, were first released in 2015.\n3.   Cloud computer providers, including Google, Microsoft and Amazon, have made it possible to rent virtual machines that contain GPU hardware and pre-installed deep learning software.  So any researcher can now access state-of-the-art deep learning hardware and software."},{"metadata":{"id":"5Kr32ap1CIkQ"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h3>Pedalogical Note</h3>\n\nWhenever possible, I will provide links to some really great training material produced by other folks.
