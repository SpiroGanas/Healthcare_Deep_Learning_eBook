The data warehouse for the United States Department of Veterans Affairs hospital system contains comprehensive clinical information on over 22 million patients.  There are over 2 trillion rows of data stored across 22,000 columns.  \n\nThe VA also has large databases of genomic and imaging data.  The publicly-available <a href=\"https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/APOLLO-1-VA\" target=\"_blank\">APOLLA-1-VA data set</a>, contains 2.6GB of medical images and 14.7GB of genomic data.  This large amount of data came from just 7 patients!\n\nMany other hospital systems and insurance companies have similarly large data warehouses.  You simply can't analyze that much data on a single computer!\n\nSo let's start talking about how to deal with this problem."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
